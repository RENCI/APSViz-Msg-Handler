how to setup for local testing of posting and pulling from a queue.

the ./test/send_test_msg.py file attaches to a queue and posts a message to it. a separate process (message handler)
must be running to assign a callback to process a message when it has been posted to a queue.

1.) port-forward to a running instance of RabbitMQ running k8s

2.) prepare the launch of ./test/send_test_msg.py
    a. command line: send_test_msgs.py -f <test data file> -q <target queue name> -d <delay>
        Where:
            <test data file> is the name of the file that contains test data
            <target queue name> is the name of the queue to send the message on the rabbit MQ server.
            <delay> pause between posting a list of test data messages to the queue.

3.) environment variables. note real values can be found in the k8s deployment values files.
    a. see environment variable in the k8s deployment scrips.

4.) starting up.
    a. start a message handler for a queue. this will act as the callback called by the host to process the message.
    b. execute the tester using the queue handler specified above.

4.) general guidelines
    a. send_test_msgs.py uses the RELAY_RABBITMQ_HOST to select the host where the message will be sent.
    b. the queue name on the host corresponds to <target queue name> on the send_test_msgs.py command line.
    c. if the target queue name doesnt exist in a message handler it will be created automatically.
    d. the queue name must already exist on the message handler startup. otherwise the message will not be handled properly.
    e. the queue management console can be used to determine if a message was received and handled.
    f. log files can be viewed to determine if the message was sent and handled properly.
    g. start all message handlers and then run send_test_msgs.py targeting each queue.
